# 🚦 Traffic Violations Insight System
### EDA, Cleaning & Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
**Montgomery County, Maryland**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Urban safety agencies generate millions of traffic-violation records each year, capturing details such as violation type, location, driver demographics, vehicle information, and enforcement-related metadata. This raw data is often noisy, inconsistent, duplicated, and difficult to interpret without systematic preprocessing and visualization.

This project builds a **complete data analytics system** that transforms a large, raw dataset of traffic violations (~2 million rows) from Montgomery County, Maryland into actionable insights through:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**
- **MariaDB Database Integration**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Python 3 | Core programming language |
| Pandas | Data cleaning & manipulation |
| NumPy | Numerical operations |
| Matplotlib / Seaborn | Static visualizations (EDA) |
| Plotly | Interactive charts (Dashboard) |
| Streamlit | Interactive web dashboard |
| MariaDB | Relational database storage |
| PyMySQL | Python-MariaDB connector |
| Folium | Geographic heatmaps (optional) |
| Git LFS | Large file storage |

---

## 🌐 Live Deployment

The dashboard is deployed and accessible at:

👉 **[Traffic Violations Insight System](https://traffic-violation-project.streamlit.app/)**

> Deployed on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)



### ⚠️ Deployment Note
 
The full dataset contains **~2 million rows (1.3GB)**. Streamlit Community Cloud's free tier has a **1GB RAM limit**, which cannot load the entire dataset into memory at once.
 
To ensure smooth deployment, the cloud version (`04_streamlit_app_cloud.py`) loads a **sample of 200,000 rows** from the dataset for visualization purposes. This sample is representative of the full dataset and covers all violation types, demographics, vehicle types, and time periods.
 
The **local version** (`04_streamlit_app.py`) connects to a local **MariaDB database** containing the full 2 million rows and displays complete data without any row limit.
 
| Version | File | Data Source | Rows |
|---------|------|-------------|------|
| Local | `04_streamlit_app.py` | MariaDB (localhost) | ~2 million |
| Cloud | `04_streamlit_app_cloud.py` | Google Drive CSV | 200,000 (sample) |

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** Montgomery County, Maryland Open Data Portal

**Size:** ~2 million rows | 43 columns

**Large files (Google Drive):**
- 📄 [traffic_violations_cleaned.csv (1.2 GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KU34HZFWNM3sHamZ18o1nzRTeReq1Okn/view?usp=sharing)
- 📦 [traffic_violations_cleaned.pkl (264 MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FfxZv8bdAsTT-bgLhvbLyOKKuE_2n8ax/view?usp=sharing)



**Key Columns:**
- `Date Of Stop`, `Time Of Stop` — When the violation occurred
- `Agency`, `SubAgency` — Law enforcement agency
- `Description`, `Violation Type` — Nature of the violation
- `Location`, `Latitude`, `Longitude` — Where it occurred
- `Race`, `Gender` — Driver demographics
- `Make`, `Model`, `VehicleType` — Vehicle details
- `Accident`, `Fatal`, `Personal Injury` — Safety indicators

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights

- Removed duplicate and inconsistent records
- Standardized date/time formats
- Normalized categorical variables (Race, Gender, Vehicle Type)
- Validated and cleaned geographic coordinates (replaced 0,0 with NaN)
- Handled missing, invalid, and out-of-range values
- Engineered new features:
  - `Hour`, `DayOfWeek`, `Month`, `Time_Bucket`
  - `Vehicle_Age`, `Violation_Category`
  - `High_Risk`, `Violation_Count`

---

## 🔍 EDA Key Findings

- **Most Common Violation:** Failure to obey traffic signals
- **Peak Hour:** Evening rush hours (5 PM – 7 PM)
- **Busiest Day:** Friday
- **Most Common Vehicle:** Automobiles (02 - Automobile)
- **Top Vehicle Make:** Toyota, Honda, Ford
- **Accident Rate:** ~3% of all violations involve accidents
- **Demographics:** Male drivers account for ~67% of violations
